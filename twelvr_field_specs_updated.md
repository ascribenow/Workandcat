## D) Consistency Rules

### difficulty_score → difficulty_band Mapping (UPDATED):
**CURRENT ACTIVE MAPPING (December 2024):**
- Easy: difficulty_score ≤ 2.00
- Medium: 2.00 < difficulty_score ≤ 2.50
- Hard: difficulty_score > 2.50
- **Implementation:** Programmatically enforced in `difficulty_calculator.py`
- **Consistency:** 100% - no exceptions, always derived from score

### pyq_frequency_score Rules:
- **Values:** Exactly {0.5, 1.0, 1.5} (discrete only)
- **Meanings:** 0.5=Low frequency, 1.0=Medium frequency, 1.5=High frequency
- **Logic:** If difficulty_score ≤ 1.5 → 0.5, else LLM comparison with category×subcategory matched PYQs
- **Lookback Window:** All PYQs in same category×subcategory (no time window limit)
- **Current Distribution:** Heavily skewed toward 1.0 (86.1% of questions)

### Difficulty Calculation Formula (NEW):
**Active Formula:** `0.25×Concepts + 0.50×Steps + 0.25×Operations`
- **Concepts:** Count of core_concepts items (capped at 5)
- **Steps:** Parsed from solution_method (≤2→2.0, ≤4→3.0, >4→5.0)  
- **Operations:** Count of operations_required items (capped at 5)
- **Range:** Theoretical 1.5-5.0, Observed 1.50-4.25

### Per-topic Normalization:
- **No per-subcategory normalization** - difficulty thresholds applied uniformly
- **No per-type_of_question normalization** - consistent formula across all question types
- **PYQ frequency matching** uses exact category×subcategory string matching

### Quality Verification Dependencies:
- quality_verified=true requires concept_extraction_status="completed"
- concept_extraction_status="completed" requires non-empty core_concepts
- questions additionally require answer_match validation
- 22-criteria checklist enforced (updated from 21)

## E) Sample Data Extracts
**Files Generated:**
- `/app/questions_field_samples_updated.csv` (50 rows, 16 fields)
- `/app/pyq_questions_field_samples_updated.csv` (50 rows, 14 fields)

Selection rule: Quality-verified rows ordered by difficulty_band, difficulty_score, subcategory to illustrate new band distribution and field diversity.

## F) Gaps List

### Recently Resolved:
1. **✅ difficulty_score calculation** - Now programmatic and consistent
2. **✅ difficulty_band mapping** - Exact thresholds defined and enforced
3. **✅ importance_band confusion** - Field permanently deleted

### Remaining Definition Gaps:
1. **22-criteria quality verification checklist** - Complete list not documented in single location
2. **LLM model selection logic** - GPT-4o vs GPT-4o-mini switching criteria not documented
3. **Solution step parsing accuracy** - No validation metrics for `parse_solution_steps()` accuracy

### Formula Gaps:
1. **Semantic answer matching thresholds** - Exact LLM prompt and similarity thresholds for answer_match unknown
2. **PYQ frequency LLM comparison** - Specific similarity calculation method not documented

### Threshold Gaps:
1. **Step counting edge cases** - Handling of complex solution formats not fully documented
2. **Concept extraction completion criteria** - Minimum requirements for "meaningful" core_concepts

### Owner Suggestions:
- **Quality verification checklist:** Documentation team + QA team
- **LLM model selection:** LLM engineering team  
- **Step parsing validation:** Content team + algorithm team
- **Semantic matching details:** LLM engineering team
- **Taxonomy standardization:** Content team + canonical taxonomy maintainers
