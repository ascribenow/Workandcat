# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Complete the taxonomy triple (Category, Subcategory, Type) implementation with 100% coverage.

**CRITICAL UPDATE REQUIRED:**
The system currently operates only at (Category, Subcategory) granularity but needs to upgrade to (Category, Subcategory, Type) granularity for all operations including session engine, mastery tracking, and data population.

**Key Requirements:**
1. **Database Schema**: All questions and PYQ questions must have complete taxonomy triple populated
2. **Session Engine**: Must operate at (Category, Subcategory, Type) granularity for selection, diversity, mastery, cooldowns
3. **LLM Enrichment**: Must classify questions with all three taxonomy levels using canonical taxonomy
4. **100% Coverage**: No 90%+ - need complete canonical compliance with no free-text drift
5. **PYQ Integration**: PYQ database must also have Category, Subcategory, Type columns populated

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Database schema supports type_of_question field
- ✅ LLM enrichment includes Type classification in canonical taxonomy  
- ✅ Complete taxonomy migration script created and partially executed (1100+ questions migrated)
- ✅ Session engine updated to use Type as first-class dimension
- ⚠️ Migration incomplete due to timeout - need to verify and complete

**Testing Objectives:**
1. **Verify Session Engine**: Test that 12-question sessions operate at (Category, Subcategory, Type) granularity
2. **Check Type Diversity**: Ensure sessions enforce Type diversity caps and metadata tracking
3. **Validate Taxonomy Coverage**: Confirm questions use canonical taxonomy with proper Type classification
4. **Test PYQ Integration**: Verify PYQ frequency weighting considers Type dimension

The category distribution fix IS WORKING CORRECTLY, but subsequent filtering stages are too aggressive. DETAILED ANALYSIS: 1) ✅ CATEGORY DISTRIBUTION FIX WORKING: Debug logs confirm system correctly selects 12 questions initially ('Final selection: 12 questions'), base_category_distribution reference fix is successful, 2) ❌ COOLDOWN FILTER TOO AGGRESSIVE: Differential cooldown filter reduces 12→6 questions ('After differential cooldown filter: 6 questions'), removes recently attempted questions too aggressively, 3) ❌ DIVERSITY ENFORCEMENT TOO STRICT: Subcategory diversity caps reduce 6→3 questions ('Enforced diversity: 3 questions from 1 subcategories'), max_questions_per_subcategory = 3 is too restrictive, 4) ❌ LIMITED QUESTION POOL DISTRIBUTION: Only A-Arithmetic category has questions (30 questions), other categories (B-Algebra, C-Geometry, D-Number System, E-Modern Math) have no questions available, all questions from single subcategory 'Time–Speed–Distance (TSD)', 5) ❌ METADATA GENERATION ERROR: 'unsupported operand type(s) for +=: float and decimal.Decimal' error in enhanced metadata generation. CONCLUSION: The base_category_distribution fix works perfectly! The issue is NOT with category distribution reference but with: 1) Overly aggressive cooldown periods, 2) Too strict diversity enforcement (3 questions per subcategory), 3) Insufficient question pool diversity across categories. SOLUTIONS: 1) Reduce cooldown periods or disable for testing, 2) Increase max_questions_per_subcategory from 3 to 12, 3) Add questions to missing categories, 4) Fix decimal type error in metadata generation. SUCCESS RATE: 44.4% (4/9 tests passed). The fix is working - just need to adjust filtering parameters!"d test CSV with 5 questions in required format (stem, year, image_url), 3) ✅ QUESTIONS CREATED: 5 PYQ questions successfully created in database with proper metadata, processed 5 CSV rows, created 5 papers for years 2020-2024, automatic LLM processing queued for category classification and solution generation, 4) ✅ FILE TRACKING WORKING: File metadata properly stored in PYQFiles table with complete details (filename: test_pyq_upload.csv, file_size: 373 bytes, processing_status: completed, questions_created: 5, years_processed: [2020-2024], uploaded_by: sumedhprabhu18@gmail.com, csv_rows_processed: 5), 5) ✅ UPLOADED FILES API: GET /api/admin/pyq/uploaded-files returns proper JSON array with file list and metadata, total files: 2, test file found in database with correct details, 6) ✅ DATABASE INTEGRATION: PYQFiles table properly populated, file tracking system operational, questions accessible via questions API.

Please contact administrator' - confirms Gmail service is not properly configured for sending verification emails, 3) ❌ VERIFY EMAIL CODE ENDPOINT: POST /api/auth/verify-email-code returns 400 'Invalid or expired verification code' for mock data - endpoint accessible but validation working (expected behavior for mock codes), 4) ❌ SIGNUP WITH VERIFICATION ENDPOINT: POST /api/auth/signup-with-verification returns 400 'Invalid or expired verification code' - endpoint accessible but requires valid verification codes, 5) ✅ REQUEST/RESPONSE VALIDATION WORKING: Proper validation for invalid email formats (422 error with detailed validation message), proper validation for missing required fields (422 error for missing 'code' field), API structure consistent with proper error responses, 6) ✅ ERROR HANDLING APPROPRIATE: Endpoints return appropriate error messages when Gmail service not configured, proper HTTP status codes for different error types, structured error responses with detailed information, 7) ✅ ADDITIONAL ENDPOINTS ACCESSIBLE: Gmail callback endpoint accessible (returns expected errors for mock authorization codes), store pending user endpoint working (returns success response). ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The email authentication system is implemented but requires Gmail OAuth2 service configuration. The endpoints are structurally correct and handle validation properly, but the underlying Gmail service integration is not configured. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) Configure Gmail OAuth2 credentials and service, 2) Set up email service configuration for verification code sending, 3) Test with proper Gmail authentication flow once configured.
