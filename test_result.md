# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🔍 GOOGLE DRIVE IMAGE INTEGRATION TESTING COMPLETE: Comprehensive testing of Google Drive Image Integration system shows 60% success rate (3/5 tests passed). ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS: Database Schema Verification - questions can be created with image fields (has_image, image_url, image_alt_text) and longer subcategory names like 'Time–Speed–Distance (TSD)' (25+ chars), confirming database schema constraint has been RESOLVED. Google Drive URL Processing - all URL formats correctly validated (drive.google.com/file/d/{ID}/view, drive.google.com/open?id={ID}, docs.google.com/document/d/{ID}/edit), proper rejection of invalid URLs. CSV Upload Integration - POST /api/admin/upload-questions-csv successfully processes CSV files with Google Drive URLs (2 questions created). ❌ ISSUES FOUND: Complete Workflow Testing - questions created with image fields but retrieval verification failed (workflow test question not found in response), Error Handling - mixed URL validation issues and CSV error handling returned 500 status instead of graceful handling. CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Database schema constraint for subcategory field has been RESOLVED - can now handle long canonical taxonomy names. However, Google Drive image processing and error handling need minor refinements for complete functionality. The core infrastructure is working but needs polish for production use."

    message: "❌ ULTIMATE COMPREHENSIVE TEST FAILED - LLM ENRICHMENT SYSTEM WITH FALLBACK NOT IMPLEMENTED: Comprehensive testing of the 'COMPLETE Fixed LLM Enrichment System with Fallback' reveals the claimed fallback system does not exist. CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1) Backend authentication and basic endpoints working ✅, 2) MCQ generation system fully operational with A,B,C,D options ✅, 3) Session management working correctly after study plan creation ✅, 4) CRITICAL FAILURE: Immediate enrichment endpoint returns HTTP 500 with LLM connection error: 'litellm.InternalServerError: OpenAIException - Connection error' ❌, 5) Question creation fails with HTTP 500 errors for all test patterns (speed, interest, percentage, work problems) ❌, 6) Existing questions (2 found) have NO enriched content - completely missing answer, solution_approach, detailed_solution fields ❌, 7) Background enrichment jobs are queued but never execute due to LLM API failure ❌, 8) CSV export functional but contains no meaningful content ❌. SUCCESS RATE: 20% (1/5 tests passed). ROOT CAUSE: The claimed 'fallback system using pattern recognition' mentioned in the review request is NOT implemented. When LLM API fails, the system does not fall back to mathematical pattern recognition to generate correct answers (50 km/h, 1200, 60, 10). Instead, it fails completely, leaving questions with no content. The fallback system that should generate accurate mathematical answers regardless of LLM availability does not exist. URGENT RECOMMENDATION: Implement actual fallback system with mathematical pattern recognition for common question types (speed-distance-time, simple interest, percentages, work problems) when LLM API is unavailable, or fix LLM API connectivity to enable proper content generation."

    message: "🔍 GOOGLE DRIVE IMAGE INTEGRATION TESTING COMPLETE: Comprehensive testing of the Google Drive integration system for CSV bulk uploads reveals 40% success rate (2/5 components working). ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS: Google Drive URL Processing (100% functional) - successfully extracts file IDs from all supported URL formats (drive.google.com/file/d/{ID}/view, drive.google.com/open?id={ID}, docs.google.com/document/d/{ID}/edit), validates Google Drive domains correctly, rejects invalid URLs properly. Image Upload Infrastructure (100% functional) - POST /api/admin/image/upload and DELETE /api/admin/image/{filename} endpoints working with proper authentication and file validation. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES BLOCKING FULL FUNCTIONALITY: CSV Upload Integration FAILED - POST /api/admin/upload-questions-csv endpoint not properly configured for Google Drive URL processing, returns 422 validation errors instead of processing CSV with Google Drive image URLs. Database Integration FAILED - question creation with image metadata blocked by the same database schema constraint affecting the broader system ('value too long for type character varying(20)'). Error Handling PARTIALLY WORKING - handles most invalid URL scenarios but some edge cases not caught. CONCLUSION: The Google Drive integration core logic (URL processing, image fetching utilities) is implemented correctly and functional, but the end-to-end workflow from CSV upload to database storage is blocked by database schema constraints and CSV processing configuration issues. The system needs database schema fixes and CSV upload endpoint improvements to achieve full Google Drive image integration for bulk uploads."

    message: "🎯 MCQ OPTIONS INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - BACKEND WORKING CORRECTLY: Comprehensive investigation of the reported issue 'MCQ options (A, B, C, D buttons) not showing up in student practice sessions' reveals the backend is functioning perfectly. ✅ INVESTIGATION FINDINGS: 1) Database Questions Structure ✅ - 5 questions found with proper format, options generated dynamically as expected, 2) MCQ Generation Working ✅ - session context generates A, B, C, D, correct options properly, 3) Session API Returns Options ✅ - /session/{id}/next-question endpoint returns complete MCQ options in response, 4) Complete Session Flow ✅ - answer submission and feedback working correctly. ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Backend generates and returns MCQ options correctly in all session API responses. The issue is NOT in the backend system. 📋 CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: The problem is in the FRONTEND SessionSystem component not properly rendering the MCQ options that are being successfully returned by the backend. Frontend developers must check the SessionSystem component's rendering logic to ensure A, B, C, D buttons are displayed when options are present in the question response. Backend testing shows 90.9% success rate (20/22 tests passed) with all MCQ-related functionality working correctly."

    message: "🎯 ENHANCED CONCEPTUAL FREQUENCY ANALYSIS SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETE: Comprehensive testing reveals the system is PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED with 50% functionality. ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS: 1) Conceptual frequency analysis endpoint (POST /api/admin/test/conceptual-frequency) fully functional - returns detailed analysis results including frequency_score, conceptual_matches, total_pyq_analyzed, top_matching_concepts, analysis_method, pattern_keywords, and solution_approach, 2) Enhanced nightly processing endpoint (POST /api/admin/run-enhanced-nightly) fully functional - returns processing results with run_id, success status, processed_at timestamp, and comprehensive statistics. ❌ MISSING COMPONENTS: 1) Database schema NOT updated with new conceptual frequency fields - questions table missing pyq_conceptual_matches, total_pyq_analyzed, top_matching_concepts, conceptual_frequency_score fields preventing persistence of analysis results, 2) LLM pattern analysis integration insufficient - 0% of questions show signs of LLM conceptual analysis, indicating the conceptual matching algorithm is not fully integrated. CONCLUSION: Backend API endpoints are implemented and working (100% API success rate), but the system cannot persist conceptual frequency analysis results due to missing database schema updates. The main agent needs to: 1) Add conceptual frequency fields to questions table schema, 2) Enhance LLM integration for conceptual pattern matching, 3) Update nightly processing to populate these fields with analysis results."

The backend code attempts to query frequency_score, pyq_conceptual_matches, total_pyq_analyzed, top_matching_concepts, frequency_analysis_method, and other new fields that don't exist in the database schema. OVERALL RESULTS: Time-Weighted Analysis ✅ PASSED (meets all review requirements), Enhanced Nightly Processing ✅ PASSED, Conceptual Analysis ❌ FAILED due to schema issues. System success rate: 33.3% (1/3 core components working). CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: Database schema must be updated with ALL frequency analysis fields (frequency_score, pyq_conceptual_matches, total_pyq_analyzed, top_matching_concepts, conceptual_frequency_score, frequency_analysis_method, temporal_pattern_data) before the Enhanced Time-Weighted Conceptual Frequency Analysis System can be fully operational.

    message: "🚨 FINAL LLM ENRICHMENT SYSTEM VALIDATION COMPLETE - CRITICAL BACKGROUND PROCESSING FAILURE: Comprehensive testing of the FULLY Fixed LLM Enrichment System reveals the system is 80% functional but has a critical background processing failure preventing content generation. ✅ WORKING PERFECTLY: 1) Question creation with proper queuing (status: 'enrichment_queued') ✅, 2) Background job system recognizes 'Advanced LLM Enrichment' feature ✅, 3) Export functionality operational ✅, 4) Multiple question creation successful ✅. ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE: Background enrichment jobs never complete execution - after 15+ seconds wait time, all created questions remain with answer=None, solution_approach=None, detailed_solution=None, is_active=None. TEST RESULTS: Created test question 'A car travels 200 km in 4 hours. What is its average speed in km/h?' (expected answer: 50 km/h) but after background processing wait, question shows no LLM-generated content. SUCCESS RATE: 80% (4/5 tests passed) but content quality test failed due to no actual LLM processing. ROOT CAUSE: Background job worker or LLM API integration not functioning - jobs are queued correctly but never processed, leaving questions with placeholder content instead of real LLM-generated answers, solutions, and classifications. This confirms the 'silly updates' issue from the review request where questions have placeholder content instead of meaningful LLM-generated content. URGENT ACTION REQUIRED: Fix background job execution pipeline to ensure LLM enrichment actually processes queued questions and populates them with real content."
