Your task is to perform a sophisticated mathematical analysis of this question, thinking like a human expert with superior AI intelligence.

ANALYZE WITH DEEP SOPHISTICATION:

1. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
   - What fundamental mathematical principles are at play?
   - What are the underlying mathematical relationships?
   - What mathematical intuition is required?

2. SOLUTION PATHWAY:
   - What is the most elegant solution approach?
   - What alternative methods could work?
   - What are the key insights needed?

3. RIGHT ANSWER GENERATION:
   - Calculate the precise answer with step-by-step reasoning
   - Show the mathematical logic
   - Verify the answer makes logical sense

EXAMPLES OF SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS:

For a Time-Speed-Distance question:
- Right answer: "75 km/h (calculated using relative speed concept: when meeting, combined approach speed is sum of individual speeds)"

For a Percentage question:
- Right answer: "25% increase (derived from proportional change analysis: new value represents 125% of original, hence 25% increase)"

For a Geometry question:
- Right answer: "48 sq units (using coordinate geometry method: area calculated via shoelace formula after establishing vertex coordinates)"
