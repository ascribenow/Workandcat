The AI engineer's trajectory commenced with stabilizing the Twelvr application, addressing critical production issues like generic MCQs and missing solutions. Initially, this involved re-enriching the database using various LLMs, pivoting to Google Gemini. A core challenge was ensuring solution readability, evolving from LaTeX/MathJax attempts to a plain Unicode mathematical notation, driven by explicit user feedback. The latter part of the trajectory focused heavily on enforcing a strict 3-section schema (Approach, Detailed Solution, Explanation) for LLM-generated content, employing a Gemini (Maker) and Anthropic (Checker) methodology. Persistent issues included formatting (cramped text, irrelevant '$' signs) and logical distinction between Approach and Explanation, which required iterative prompt refinements, code adjustments (e.g.,  function), and repeated re-enrichment of the entire question database. The work culminated in applying the fully refined maker-checker system to existing questions to achieve consistent, high-quality, textbook-like content.

<product_requirements>
The Twelvr application is an AI-powered CAT Quantitative Aptitude preparation platform, designed for personalized, adaptive learning with a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and PostgreSQL database. The primary goal is to provide high-quality, AI-enriched educational content.

Key requirements and issues addressed during this trajectory include:
*   **Database Reconciliation**: Ensuring all questions from a provided CSV are present and enriched in the database, resolving discrepancies in question counts due to format differences.
*   **Solution Quality & Format**: Providing clear, step-by-step solutions with theoretical context, specifically in human-friendly, plain Unicode mathematical notation (no LaTeX). Solutions must be structured into three distinct sections: a short Approach (exam strategy), a Detailed Solution (numbered steps, visual, student-friendly), and a concise Explanation (conceptual takeaway).
*   **LLM Integration & Consistency**: Implementing a robust LLM enrichment pipeline using Google Gemini as the primary content generator (Maker) and Anthropic as a quality validator (Checker) to ensure all generated content adheres to the defined schema and quality standards. This includes fixing  issues for Anthropic and ceasing use of the Emergent LLM Key.
*   **Content Presentation**: Eliminating irrelevant '$' signs from solutions and ensuring proper line breaks, spacing, and textbook-like presentation for both solutions and question stems in the frontend.
*   **MCQ Randomization**: Randomizing the placement of correct MCQ options.
*   **Admin/Dashboard Enhancements**: Reorganizing admin panel buttons and implementing a simplified student dashboard showing session counts and taxonomy-based progress.
*   **Adaptive Learning Logic**: Correctly calculating  and ensuring  is used for question selection and mastery tracking.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two critical issues identified by the user:
1.  **Irrelevant '$' signs**: These were appearing in the solutions, indicating a lingering LaTeX artifact or LLM generation issue.
2.  **Approach vs. Explanation Duplication**: The Approach and Explanation sections were often identical or lacked distinct purpose, contrary to the user's detailed directive. The user also emphasized that the Detailed Solution should read like a human-teacher's explanation, not an LLM's thought process.

To fix these, the AI engineer undertook the following actions:
*   **Code Modifications**:
    *   **Backend ()**: Modified the  function to strip irrelevant  signs.
    *   **Schema Manager ()**: Updated LLM system prompts for both Gemini (maker) and Anthropic/OpenAI (checker) to:
        *   Explicitly instruct against generating  signs.
        *   Emphasize the distinct roles and examples for Approach and Explanation.
        *   Reinforce the need for a human-teaching tone in Detailed Solution.
    *   **Standardized Enrichment Engine ()**:
        *   Ensured the  method is correctly called to embed the distinct Approach and Explanation into the final solution structure.
        *   Added a  method (and integrated its usage) to apply a final pass of cleaning, including  sign removal, to LLM outputs.
*   **Testing & Verification**: The AI engineer ran  multiple times, confirming that:
    *    signs were successfully removed.
    *   Approach and Explanation were generated distinctly and rated Excellent by Anthropic, with low word overlap.
    *   The overall tone and quality of solutions matched the user's teacher-explaining requirement.
*   **Current Execution**: Upon successful testing of the fixes on sample questions, the user confirmed to proceed with applying these fixes to the entire database. The AI engineer created and initiated the execution of the  script, which is currently running in the background to re-process and update all existing 127 questions in the database with the newly refined, schema-compliant, and high-quality content.

The system is now in the process of applying these critical quality and consistency improvements to the entire question bank.
