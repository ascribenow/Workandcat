The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and is managing the LLM enrichment of regular questions (75.2% complete). Critical issues were identified:  incorrectly filters PYQ questions by their difficulty instead of the regular question's, and  isn't correctly updated in the regular enrichment service, leading to data inconsistencies. A fix plan for the  has been committed to memory with a specific trigger phrase. Additionally, comprehensive mathematical rendering using KaTeX, , and  was successfully implemented in the frontend. Significant database cleanup was performed, deleting 13 redundant tables to prepare for a new session and adaptivity architecture. The system is currently in a session forked state, awaiting user instruction to proceed with either new session logic or the queued  fix.

The Twelvr application is an adaptive CAT preparation platform that uses LLM-assisted features for high-quality enrichment of PYQs and regular questions, leveraging OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic. It integrates Razorpay payments, a referral system, and adaptive session logic backed by PostgreSQL. Key enhancements include a  field for CSV-populated content and a new LLM-based  calculation for regular questions. The platform standardized LLM enrichment across question types, removed arbitrary answer length validation, and implemented an LLM-semantic-match  field. A crucial architectural change decoupled CSV upload from LLM enrichment, now triggered separately via admin endpoints, similar to PYQ. All LLM-generated fields and 8 CSV fields undergo a strict 21-criteria quality verification. Recent work included mathematical display (KaTeX) and database cleanup for a new session/adaptivity structure.

-   ****: Defines PostgreSQL schema, with  and  models central to the application.
    -   **Changes**:  was added to .  model was refactored previously. A significant number of tables were deleted (13 tables, including , , , , , ,  related tables) to streamline the database for a new session/adaptivity architecture.
-   ****: FastAPI application, API endpoints. Handles all API requests, including admin endpoints for question upload and enrichment.
    -   **Changes**: Introduced admin endpoints (, , ) for regular questions, mirroring PYQ. The  endpoint is a synchronous, manual trigger.
-   ****: Contains the core LLM enrichment logic for non-PYQ questions.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed synchronous database calls. Ported advanced semantic matching from PYQ service. Implemented a 3-step category population logic. Standardized LLM prompts. Implemented  semantic comparison. Updated quality verification (21 criteria).
    -   **Critical Flaw**: Still missing explicit setting of  after successful enrichment and the quality verification does not check this field. Also, the  filter for  is incorrectly applied to  instead of the .
-   ****: Centralizes LLM operations, including fallback logic and  calculation.
    -   **Changes**: Contains  for LLM-based frequency score. Implements multi-level LLM fallback (OpenAI GPT-4o -> GPT-4o-mini -> Gemini-pro).
-   ****: Frontend component for displaying question details and solutions.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to integrate  component for mathematical content in , MCQ options, , , , and .
-   ** (CREATED)**: New React component responsible for rendering mathematical content.
    -   **Importance**: Handles KaTeX integration with  and . Implements dual detection (LaTeX delimiters + safe auto-enhancement for Unicode math), expression-level fallback to sanitized plain text on KaTeX parse errors, and detect-then-render performance optimization.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the  logic (difficulty filter, one-time recalculation, update main enrichment flow). This is a known plan, ready to be triggered by Execute PYQ Frequency Fix Plan - Phase 2 Ready.
- Fix the  inconsistency (missing update in regular enrichment service, missing check in quality verification).
- Design and implement a new session and adaptivity structure following the database cleanup.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed two major tasks:
1.  **Mathematical Rendering Implementation**: Implemented KaTeX-based mathematical rendering in the frontend using  and . This involved creating a  component with dual detection for LaTeX delimiters and safe auto-enhancement of Unicode math symbols, expression-level fallback, and performance optimizations. This has been fully integrated into  to display all mathematical content (stems, solutions, options) beautifully and has been successfully verified.
2.  **Database Cleanup**: Performed a significant database refactoring by deleting 13 tables from the public schema (including , , , , , , , , , , ). This cleanup removed approximately 480 rows of legacy data and reduced the total table count from 25 to 12, preparing the database for a new session and adaptivity structure. This operation also explicitly deleted all existing session and mastery tracking data.

In parallel, the **LLM enrichment process for regular questions is ongoing**:
-   **Current Status**: 340 out of 452 questions are enriched, marking 75.2% completion.
-   **Processing**: The system is processing questions sequentially in batches, with the current batch actively enriching Time-Work efficiency problems.
-   **Performance**: The enrichment is proceeding with a 100% success rate for quality verification (21 criteria checks), utilizing OpenAI GPT-4o, with a configured fallback to Gemini.
-   **Known Issues**: Two critical flaws have been identified but not yet fixed:
    1.  ** logic**: The  filter is incorrectly applied to PYQ questions instead of the regular question being enriched. A detailed 4-phase fix plan has been memorized.
    2.  ****: Regular questions are marked  but their  remains  because the enrichment service does not explicitly set it to , and the quality verification doesn't check this status.

The current work context is a session forked state, preserving this comprehensive context.

Monitor the ongoing LLM enrichment process until 100% completion.
