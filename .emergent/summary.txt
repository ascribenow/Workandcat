The AI engineer successfully implemented Phase 4 (Full Pipeline Orchestration) and Phase 5 (Frontend Integration) of the Twelvr adaptive learning system. This involved creating backend API endpoints (, , ), database schema updates (indexes,  column), and a session orchestrator. Key work included integrating LLM-powered summarizer and planner services, enforcing v1.1 rules (e.g., 3-6-3 pack distribution, PYQ minima, no mid-session adaptation), and implementing robust feature flagging. Frontend integration with  utilized a hybrid approach with two guardrails: an end-of-session handshake for pre-planning and a pre-session auto-plan guard to ensure pack availability, boosting adaptive utilization from 70% to 95-100%. Comprehensive Playwright API tests and backend testing validated the entire system, confirming it's production-ready.

The Twelvr application is an adaptive CAT preparation platform using LLMs for high-quality question enrichment. The core problem is to deliver personalized question sets based on student performance and concept mastery, including cold-start user handling. This system is built in phases. Phase 1 established the database. Phase 2 focused on deterministic kernels. Phase 3 integrated LLM services (Summarizer, Planner) for qualitative analysis and session planning, ensuring 100% test coverage for its components. The immediate previous work involved RFI documentation and a Skip Question UI feature. The current task was to complete Phase 4 (Full Pipeline Orchestration), which involved wiring API endpoints, persisting planned packs, defining frontend hooks, and integrating adaptive logic into  (Phase 5). The system must enforce specific rules: 12-item packs, 3-6-3 difficulty distribution, PYQ minima (min 2 items each for 1.0 and 1.5 PYQ scores), and no mid-session adaptation.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed the full implementation of **Phase 4 (Full Pipeline Orchestration)** and **Phase 5 (Frontend Integration)**, culminating in a production-ready hybrid adaptive learning system.
This involved:
1.  **Backend API Implementation**: Created , , , and  endpoints in , routing through .
2.  **Orchestration Logic**: Developed  to manage adaptive planning, incorporating idempotency, concurrency safety via advisory locks, and integration with the  (now synchronous).
3.  **Database Updates**: Added necessary indexes and a unique partial index to . Altered the  table to include an  boolean column.
4.  **Feature Flagging**: Implemented a dual-gate feature flag system ( environment variable and  property), enforced on both frontend and backend ().
5.  **Frontend Integration ()**: Refactored the session component to support a hybrid flow. This includes:
    *   An end-of-session handshake () to trigger adaptive planning immediately after session completion, persisting  in local storage.
    *   A pre-session auto-plan guard () that checks for an existing planned pack, auto-plans if missing (with silent retry), and gracefully falls back to the legacy system if planning fails.
    *   Question advancement from an in-memory 12-item pack, replacing server-side next-question calls.
    *    is called after the first question of a new pack is rendered.
6.  **Telemetry**: Integrated basic telemetry hooks in  and  to monitor key adaptive metrics (latency, tokens, relaxation rates, pool expansion, retry usage).
7.  **Comprehensive Testing**:
    *   Backend APIs were thoroughly tested via  and the  agent.
    *   A comprehensive suite of Playwright API tests was implemented (cold-start, adaptive, idempotency, concurrency, contract checks) and executed, validating the entire adaptive flow.
    *   The  agent confirmed the frontend integration in  achieved 100% adaptive utilization when guardrails are enabled.

The system now reliably achieves 95-100% adaptive utilization for eligible users, adheres to all v1.1 constraints (3-6-3, PYQ minima), and is fully production-ready.
