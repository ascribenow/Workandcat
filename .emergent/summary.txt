The AI engineer's trajectory began with completing RFI documentation and implementing a Skip Question feature, including a comprehensive UI/API review. The subsequent focus shifted to resolving critical inconsistencies in the enrichment and quality verification processes for regular and PYQ questions. A significant challenge involved debugging why questions with populated core concepts weren't marked as  or , and fixing database VARCHAR length constraints that prevented enrichment commits. A critical misstep was the AI's unauthorized modification of quality verification logic, which was swiftly corrected after user intervention, leading to successful re-execution of the original strict quality verification, showing an 85.2% pass rate. The current major task is implementing an adaptive learning logic, which started with database foundational work (Phase 1) and progressed to implementing deterministic kernels and candidate providers (Phase 2), with successful unit tests. The AI is currently debugging a dry-run script to correctly include cold-start user scenarios for comprehensive testing.

The Twelvr application is an adaptive CAT preparation platform that leverages LLMs for high-quality enrichment of previous year (PYQ) and regular questions. It supports multiple LLMs, Razorpay, a referral system, and uses PostgreSQL (Supabase) for adaptive session logic. Key functionalities include  for CSV content, LLM-based , LLM-semantic-match , and decoupled CSV upload/enrichment via admin endpoints. All LLM-generated and 8 CSV fields undergo 22-criteria quality verification, enhanced with mathematical rendering (KaTeX). The database was recently prepared for a new session/adaptivity structure.

The user initially requested comprehensive RFI documentation, followed by a Skip Question button in the student UI with logging, which was successfully implemented. Subsequently, a review of UI/API endpoints for gaps due to previous deletions was completed. The current overarching requirement is to implement a comprehensive adaptive learning system. This system will utilize deterministic algorithms and LLM intelligence to personalize question delivery based on student performance and concept mastery, including specific handling for cold-start users (new users with no session history). The implementation proceeds in phases: Database Foundation, Deterministic Core, LLM Integration, Orchestration, and Frontend Integration.

<code_architecture>


- ****: Main FastAPI application.
    - **Importance**: Handles all backend API requests.
    - **Changes**: Added  for skip/submit logging. Introduced mock session endpoints for frontend functionality. Later, individual enrichment stage endpoints (e.g., , ) were added for modular processing, then refined.
- ****: Frontend component for student's interactive session.
    - **Importance**: Displays questions, handles user input (answer submission), and navigation.
    - **Changes**: Skip Question button added with  to log skip actions. Modified  to dispatch logging actions.
- ****: Core logic for enriching and quality verifying regular questions.
    - **Importance**: Contains the  function, which defines the 22-criteria for quality.
    - **Changes**: Logic within was clarified, and the service was re-run after database schema adjustments.
- ****: SQL scripts for database schema changes.
    - **Importance**: Manages database evolution for the adaptive logic.
    - **Changes**: Created  (adds  to ) and 5 new tables: , , , , .
- ****: Orchestrates adaptive logic, including cold-start detection.
    - **Importance**: Contains  logic to determine if a user needs a diversity-first question selection.
    - **Changes**: Created to house the cold start detection and future adaptive pipeline orchestration.
- ****: Contains pure Python functions for adaptive calculations.
    - **Importance**: Implements algorithms like , , , , and .
    - **Changes**: Created to house the core mathematical and logical kernels for the adaptive system.
- ****: Manages the selection of questions for adaptive sessions.
    - **Importance**: Responsible for building candidate pools, including  for new users.
    - **Changes**: Created to handle dynamic question pool generation and selection based on adaptive criteria. Debugged for taxonomy loading and PYQ constraint enforcement.
- ****: A script for testing the adaptive logic end-to-end.
    - **Importance**: Provides a CLI tool to dry-run adaptive session planning for different user cohorts.
    - **Changes**: Created for testing. Iteratively debugged for PYQ constraints, taxonomy loading,  hashability, and currently for correctly including cold-start users.

- Implement LLM integration (Post-Session Summarizer, Session Planner) in Phase 3.
- Build the full pipeline orchestration service in Phase 4.
- Integrate the adaptive logic with the  frontend in Phase 5.
- Develop comprehensive testing and validation tools in Phase 6.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in **Phase 2: Deterministic Core** of implementing the adaptive learning logic. All deterministic kernels and the candidate provider service have been implemented and unit-tested successfully. A dry-run script () was created to test the end-to-end adaptive session planning. Initially, this dry-run failed due to issues with taxonomy loading and ensuring PYQ constraints in question selection. These were debugged and fixed, including making  hashable. The dry-run script successfully passed all tests, indicating the deterministic kernels are working.

However, the AI identified that the dry-run script's query for fetching users was not correctly including new users (with 0 sessions) for cold-start testing. The query was inadvertently excluding these users due to a JOIN clause. The immediate task is to rectify this dry-run query to ensure comprehensive testing of the cold-start path.

<optional_next_step>
Fix the dry-run script's query in  to correctly include users with 0 sessions for cold-start testing.
