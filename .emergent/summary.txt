The AI engineer's work on the Twelvr adaptive learning system began with resolving fundamental issues like a  type mismatch and ensuring session persistence, involving significant refactoring across several backend services. A critical frontend deployment issue serving a stale build also required a hotfix. The core challenge became diagnosing and optimizing slow  requests, which were often timing out due to LLM planner performance and inefficient database queries. This led to a comprehensive V2 redesign, implementing an ID-only LLM contract, seeded hash-based candidate selection, and composite indexes, successfully reducing  times from 98.7s to approximately 10-15s.

Despite these performance gains, persistent frontend integration problems emerged, including empty question content and generic MCQ options. These were addressed by refining V2 pack assembly and correcting parsing logic. However, the most critical and recurring issue was the session blanking out or redirecting to the dashboard midway through user interaction. Initial investigations pointed to premature session completion triggers and a syntax error. The current, unresolved problem is that the  state inexplicably becomes empty, even after being successfully populated, causing the Session pack is empty error and rendering the platform unusable. To diagnose this, micro-instrumentation (pack history recorder, route trace) has been added, and relevant codebase snippets have been compiled into a  folder for detailed user review.

The Twelvr application is an adaptive CAT preparation platform that uses LLMs to create personalized question sets, manage cold-start users, and deliver high-quality content. The primary goal is to dynamically optimize learning paths.

Previous work established Phase 4 (Full Pipeline Orchestration) and Phase 5 (Frontend Integration), focusing on API wiring, pack persistence, frontend hooks, and integrating adaptive logic into . Core requirements include 12-item packs with a 3-6-3 difficulty distribution (Easy/Medium/Hard), a minimum of 2 questions each for PYQ scores of 1.0 and 1.5, and no mid-session adaptation. The system features a hybrid frontend with a legacy fallback, dual-gate feature flags (, ), and guardrails for post-completion and pre-session auto-plan.

Initial implementation addressed a summarizer  type mismatch and uncovered deeper session persistence issues (sessions not created during planning), leading to significant refactoring. A critical frontend deployment issue caused sessions to be stuck due to an old build pointing to an incorrect backend URL, necessitating a proxy hotfix and frontend rebuild. Subsequent LLM planner performance (timeout) and schema validation errors (missing , ), coupled with a  column size issue, were identified and fixed in the backend. Most recently, while performance has drastically improved (98.7s to ~10-15s), the frontend experiences sessions going blank or displaying Session pack is empty after submission, rendering the platform unusable.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical frontend issue: sessions loading, but then displaying an Session pack is empty. Please refresh to restart. error message or going blank immediately after a user attempts to submit an answer. This renders the platform unusable for users.

Despite previous attempts to fix state management, legacy fallback calls, and frontend syntax errors, the issue persisted. The engineer implemented targeted micro-instrumentation to gather precise diagnostic data:
1.  ****: Logs every attempt to set the  state, including the length of the pack and the call stack. This  aims to pinpoint where the pack is being inadvertently cleared or overwritten.
2.  ** ()**: Logs route changes to detect any unexpected navigations or redirects.

Initial testing with this instrumentation revealed that while the  is successfully set with 12 items, the component appears to evaluate it as empty when  is called. This indicates a complex React state update timing issue or potential race condition.

To facilitate further debugging, the engineer has created a  folder containing all relevant frontend and backend code snippets (SessionSystem.js, Dashboard.js, AuthProvider.js, packHistoryRecorder.js, sessionMonitoring.js, and backend handlers for pack/attempt endpoints) along with the initial diagnostic data captured by the instrumentation. This folder is prepared for a line-by-line code review by the user to collaboratively identify the root cause of the  state corruption.
