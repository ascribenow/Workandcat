The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer on the Twelvr adaptive learning system, inheriting a 0 to 1 app and tasked with fixing critical issues. Initially, the focus was on resolving a summarizer  type mismatch and ensuring session persistence. This led to significant refactoring in , , and , and standardizing timestamp handling.

A major challenge emerged with frontend deployment, where  served a stale build pointing to the wrong API host. This necessitated extensive debugging and the creation of a comprehensive Nginx reverse proxy hotpatch, alongside a permanent frontend build fix. Concurrently, a severe performance bottleneck due to an LLM planner timeout and schema validation failures required updates to  and . The final identified issue, after multiple deployments, was empty question content due to a database column size mismatch ( too short) and an LLM-generated schema error (missing ), both addressed in the backend. The conversation ends with these backend fixes awaiting final deployment to production to fully resolve the empty session content.

The Twelvr application is an adaptive CAT preparation platform that leverages LLMs to provide personalized question sets, manage cold-start users, and ensure high-quality content. The core problem is to dynamically optimize learning paths.

The previous work established Phase 4 (Full Pipeline Orchestration) and Phase 5 (Frontend Integration), wiring API endpoints, persisting planned packs, defining frontend hooks, and integrating adaptive logic into . Key requirements include 12-item packs with a 3-6-3 difficulty distribution (3 Easy, 6 Medium, 3 Hard), a minimum of 2 questions each for PYQ scores of 1.0 and 1.5, and no mid-session adaptation. The system features a hybrid frontend with legacy fallback, dual-gate feature flags ( and ), and guardrails for post-completion planning and pre-session auto-plan.

So far, the system has achieved 100% compliance with core adaptive logic and API contracts. Metadata fields are mostly populated. However, initial work focused on fixing the summarizer's  type mismatch, which then uncovered deeper session persistence issues (sessions not created during planning). This led to significant refactoring. Subsequently, a critical frontend deployment issue caused sessions to be stuck due to an old build pointing to the wrong backend URL, necessitating a proxy hotfix and frontend rebuild. Finally, LLM planner performance (timeout) and schema validation errors (missing  and ), coupled with a  column size issue, were identified and fixed in the backend, awaiting final deployment.

- ****: Handles post-session LLM summarization.
    - **Importance**: Processes  to generate session summaries and concept alias maps.
    - **Changes**: Refactored  method to correctly resolve  from  before fetching  by . Added persistence logic for  and  directly within the  method, making it async.
- ****: Manages adaptive session planning and pack saving.
    - **Importance**: Orchestrates the entire adaptive session flow, from planning to persistence.
    - **Changes**: Modified  to generate and insert records into the  table (with transaction-safe  for ) alongside . Ensured  updates use server-side  and preserve  on conflict. Extended  VARCHAR length in  table from 50 to 100.
- ****: Manages session start and completion timestamps.
    - **Importance**: Updates  and  tables, and triggers the summarizer.
    - **Changes**: Updated calls to the  service to use the new async API signature . Replaced Python  with SQL  for  and  timestamps.
- ****: Adaptive API endpoints.
    - **Importance**: Exposes endpoints for planning and managing adaptive sessions.
    - **Changes**: Updated the  endpoint to handle async  calls. Added a timeout mechanism for the LLM planner.
- ****: LLM-powered session planner.
    - **Importance**: Generates personalized question packs based on user history and constraints.
    - **Changes**: Updated the system prompt to explicitly request the  in the LLM output. Added a safety check to ensure  is always present in the LLM response, with a fallback if missing. Corrected a schema mismatch in the fallback plan where  was used instead of .
- ****: Database configuration and models.
    - **Importance**: Defines database connection and schema.
    - **Changes**: Extended  column type from  to  across relevant tables (, , ).
- ****: Frontend session logic.
    - **Importance**: Manages the user's interactive session, including API calls for planning, fetching, and completing packs.
    - **Changes**: Modified to ensure  completes before  fetch. Added  timeout configuration to API calls to align with backend changes. Modified to use relative API URLs () instead of hardcoded full URLs. Added service worker unregistration code for cache busting.
- ****: Frontend environment variables.
    - **Importance**: Configures frontend behavior and API endpoints.
    - **Changes**: Corrected  to .  was temporarily set to  and then to an empty string to enable relative API calls.
- ** (External to codebase)**:
    - **Importance**: Critical for routing frontend  calls to the correct backend host (hotpatch).
    - **Changes**: Instructions were provided for a reverse proxy rule (e.g., ) and various safety/monitoring features (rollback switch, log rotation, health checks, security headers, rate limiting).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving a critical issue where sessions were loading slowly (>60 seconds) and displaying empty question content despite the overall site loading normally and the previous API URL configuration fix being deployed.

The root causes identified for the empty question content were:
1.  **Database Column Size Issue**: The  field in the database (, , ) was , but some generated session IDs were 55 characters long, causing database insertion failures. This was fixed by extending the column size to  in relevant migration scripts or directly within  (though the exact file for this schema change is not provided in trajectory, the fix was confirmed).
2.  **LLM Planner Schema Mismatch**: The LLM was sometimes failing to generate the  field, leading to JSON schema validation errors. Additionally, the fallback planner was using  while the schema expected .
    -   This was addressed in  by:
        -   Updating the system prompt to explicitly ask for the  in the JSON output.
        -   Adding a safety check to ensure  is always present, providing a default if missing.
        -   Correcting the fallback plan to use  consistently.
3.  **LLM Planner Performance**: The LLM planner was frequently timing out (30-60+ seconds). This was addressed by adding timeout handling in  for the  endpoint and ensuring proper async processing. Frontend timeouts were also adjusted in  to match the backend.

After implementing these backend fixes in the development environment, testing confirmed significant performance improvements (3-10 second response times for planning) and schema compliance. However, the empty question content issue persisted on  because these *backend* fixes had not yet been deployed to the production environment, causing the production backend to still fail at session planning and content delivery.
