The trajectory chronicles the transition of the Twelvr adaptive learning system from an AI engineer to a human expert. Initially, the AI engineer claimed to have completed Phases 4 and 5, achieving high adaptive utilization. However, upon receiving a detailed v1.1 handoff packet, the user tasked the AI with auditing the existing codebase against the specification, identifying gaps, and implementing fixes.

The AI engineer successfully completed a multi-phase process: an audit (Phase A), identified and fixed critical gaps in middleware, database indexes, API contracts, and constraint enforcement (Phase B), and addressed data capture issues for LLM-generated analytics (Fixes 1-5). It also wired up session lifecycle endpoints (start/completion) to populate  table timestamps. Throughout, the AI demonstrated iterative problem-solving, debugging import errors, and correcting logic for PYQ minima enforcement.

The system is now 100% compliant with the v1.1 core adaptive logic, including pack generation, constraint enforcement, and API contracts. Most metadata fields (, , ) are correctly populated. However, LLM analytics tables (, ) remain empty due to a persistent  type mismatch (expected integer, received string UUID) in the summarizer's database query, and the need for actual  in test sessions.

The Twelvr application is an adaptive CAT preparation platform using LLMs to deliver personalized question sets, manage cold-start users, and ensure high-quality question enrichment. The core problem is to optimize learning paths through dynamic content.

The previous work involved implementing Phase 4 (Full Pipeline Orchestration) and Phase 5 (Frontend Integration) to wire API endpoints, persist planned packs, define frontend hooks, and integrate adaptive logic into . Key rules include 12-item packs with a 3-6-3 difficulty distribution (3 Easy, 6 Medium, 3 Hard), a minimum of 2 questions each for PYQ scores of 1.0 and 1.5, and no mid-session adaptation. The system should feature a hybrid frontend with legacy fallback, dual-gate feature flags ( and ), and two guardrails: an end-of-session handshake for post-completion planning and a pre-session auto-plan guard for pack availability with retry logic. Comprehensive testing and monitoring for adaptive utilization, pack-miss rates, LLM latencies, and forbidden relaxations are also required for a safe rollout ladder.

<current_work>
The Twelvr Adaptive (v1.1) system has reached a highly compliant and functional state. All core adaptive features, including session planning, pack generation (12 items with 3-6-3 difficulty, PYQ minima), API contracts (e.g.,  enforcement), and constraint validation (no forbidden relaxations), are working as specified.

Recent work focused on resolving data capture gaps for LLM analytics and ensuring proper session lifecycle tracking. The AI engineer:
1.  **Fixed Summarizer Column Mismatches**: Updated  to use correct column names for inserting into  and .
2.  **Wired Session Lifecycle Endpoints**: Created  with  and  endpoints, handled by .
3.  **Added Frontend Hooks**: Integrated calls to these new lifecycle endpoints in  to mark session start (on first question render) and completion (after final attempt flush).
4.  **Ensured Metadata Population**: Correctly populates , ,  (e.g., planner_fallback@v1.1), and .
5.  **Hardened LLM JSON Processing**: Implemented , , and post-processing cleanup in  to make LLM responses more robust.

The system is currently production-ready for its core adaptive learning functionality. However, the LLM analytics tables (, ) remain empty because the summarizer, while correctly called, fails to process data due to an SQL query expecting an integer  format when UUID strings are provided.
