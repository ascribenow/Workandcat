The previous AI engineer successfully consolidated LLM utilities into , refactored enrichment services (, ), and streamlined  by removing outdated dependencies. A significant database schema refactoring for the  table occurred, adding  and removing 12 fields and all relationships. This also involved fixing multiple admin endpoint issues and test detection logic, achieving 100% success. Most recently, the engineer implemented a new LLM-based  calculation for regular questions, which critically failed due to  fields being null in the  table, despite being essential for the new filtering logic. The engineer meticulously debugged and confirmed the data inconsistency, presenting options for resolution to the user.

<product_requirements>
The Twelvr application is an adaptive CAT preparation platform with LLM-assisted features. Key requirements include high-quality LLM enrichment for PYQs and regular questions, using a unified Enrich Checker and single Canonical Taxonomy. This involves OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic for semantic validation. The enrichment flow was consolidated into a single LLM call for initial stages, with detailed descriptions for semantic matching and difficulty assessment using specific criteria. Quality validation is a two-step LLM and code-based process. The application features robust Razorpay payment integration, a student referral system, and adaptive session logic with per-student coverage tracking, exclusively using PostgreSQL. Recent updates introduced a  field (CSV-populated, displayed above  in UI) and a new LLM-based  calculation for regular questions, replacing previous complex frequency analysis.

-   ****: Defines the PostgreSQL database schema using SQLAlchemy.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for defining data structure and relationships for all application entities.
    -   **Changes**:  length increased to .  model was extensively refactored: added  (Text); removed , , LLM assessment fields, specific frequency analysis fields, and all previous relationships (Topic, QuestionOption, Attempt).  and  were also removed from the  model.
-   ****: The core FastAPI application, handling API endpoints and background tasks.
    -   **Importance**: Manages all client-server communication, orchestrates enrichment processes, and serves as the backend entry point.
    -   **Changes**: Updated enrichment endpoint logic to use new services and ensure graceful handling of NULL taxonomy fields. Fixed  to correctly use  and ensure data consistency. CSV upload logic was updated for new/deleted fields. All code references to the recently deleted frequency and impact fields were removed.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a major refactoring phase for the regular questions enrichment system. This involved updating the database schema by deleting  and  fields from the  table and applying the necessary migration. A new LLM-based  calculation logic was implemented in  via the  function, and integrated into . This new logic compares a regular question against PYQ questions where  and  x  match the regular question. The LLM then semantically matches  x  (>50% similarity), returning 0.5 (for 0 matches), 1.0 (for 1-3 matches), or 1.5 (for >3 matches) as the score.

However, during validation, a critical issue was discovered: all PYQ questions in the  table have . This directly impedes the new  calculation, which relies on matching the  and  of the regular question with PYQ questions. The  and  fields in PYQ questions are correctly populated, but the missing  data prevents the required filtering from yielding any results. The AI engineer re-verified the database to confirm this  status.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to address the  issue for PYQ questions to enable the new  calculation to work. The user is being asked whether to apply a quick fix (modify filtering to exclude ) or a complete fix (populate PYQ categories). Ask the user for approval or alternatives before proceeding.
