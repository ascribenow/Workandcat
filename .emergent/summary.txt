The previous AI engineer successfully migrated a CAT preparation MVP from MongoDB/FastAPI/React to a PostgreSQL-based production system. This involved extensive backend re-engineering, including SQLAlchemy integration for 15+ tables and the implementation of core AI modules for question enrichment, study planning, and mastery tracking. Initial work focused on fixing critical integration issues and bugs related to diagnostic systems and formula integration, and explicitly removing diagnostic functionality per user request. Subsequently, the engineer addressed a comprehensive feedback document, implementing new formulas, enhancing the database schema, refining core business logic (e.g., attempt spacing, mastery thresholds), and adding a much-needed interactive student session and detailed progress dashboard. The latest work involves a deep dive into refining the nightly processing engine based on new user feedback, specifically updating the deterministic difficulty formula and setting up an enhanced background job engine.

<product_requirements>
The application is a comprehensive CAT Quantitative Aptitude preparation platform designed for personalized and adaptive learning. Initially an MVP, it transitioned to a PostgreSQL/FastAPI/React stack. Key features include: a PostgreSQL backend with 15+ tables, AI-powered question scoring using a 4-factor difficulty formula and LLM enrichment. An adaptive study planning system offers three tracks, rolling units, and daily minimums without manual student selection. Attempt management limits questions to 3 tries with retry intervals. Nightly background jobs update learning impact and mastery. MCQ generation is real-time with distractors. Authentication uses JWT, with hardcoded admin access. The UI is minimalistic for students (Dashboard, Study Plan, Practice) and streamlined for admin (PYQ/Question Upload, Export), supporting .docx, .doc, and .pdf. A canonical QA taxonomy categorizes content into 5 main categories and 29 subcategories. Initially, a 25-question diagnostic test was a core feature for new users, but this functionality was explicitly removed per user request. The system also includes detailed progress tracking by category, subcategory, and question type, including questions solved by difficulty level.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on addressing a new set of feedback related to refining the **nightly update logic**. This feedback highlighted that while current data capture, EWMA mastery, plan regeneration, and difficulty recomputation were functioning, 8 critical gaps needed to be addressed in the nightly processing system.

The work currently in progress involves:
1.  **Deterministic Difficulty Formula Update**: The  function in  has been replaced with a more deterministic  function. This change ensures a precise and consistent calculation of question difficulty, crucial for adaptive learning.
    
2.  **Enhanced Nightly Processing Engine Creation**: A new file, , has been created. This script is intended to house the comprehensive logic for the refined nightly processing, incorporating all 8 identified fixes from the latest feedback.

The next immediate step is to integrate this newly created  into the existing  to ensure these refinements are part of the scheduled nightly updates. This ensures the system continuously learns and adapts based on the most precise algorithms.
