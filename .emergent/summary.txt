The AI engineer successfully addressed multiple critical issues in the Twelvr adaptive learning platform. Initial work fixed a stale-closure + double-boot race in , resolving the Session pack is empty error by using  and state-driven effects, achieving 89.3% test success. Subsequent fixes clarified frontend state management and adapted backend responses for rich solution feedback and an Ask Twelvr AI tutor (Google Gemini), achieving 100% functionality. A critical  data loss was identified but not resolved by code. Further work implemented robust session completion and progress tracking, including resumption logic, fixing database logging and dashboard data display. Finally, the MCQ answer comparison logic was refined for 100% accuracy, ensuring only the  field is used. The analytics pipeline was architecturally improved with a dedicated LLM service, though full LLM summarization depends on proper environment configuration. The latest fixes addressed solution display and accurate answer sourcing from the  field, reaching a 100% functional and compliant state.

<product_requirements>
The Twelvr application is an adaptive CAT preparation platform that leverages LLMs for personalized question sets, cold-start user management, and high-quality content delivery, aiming to optimize learning paths. Key requirements include 12-item packs with a 3-6-3 difficulty distribution (Easy/Medium/Hard), minimum PYQ scores, and no mid-session adaptation. It features a hybrid frontend, dual-gate feature flags (, ), and guardrails.

Previous work established API wiring, pack persistence, and frontend integration. Initial problems included  type mismatches, session persistence failures, and frontend deployment issues. Later, LLM planner timeouts and schema validation errors were resolved with a V2 redesign, reducing  times to 10-15s. However, the frontend experienced Session pack is empty errors. The user also explicitly requested: detailed solution feedback (snap read, approach, detailed solution, principle to remember), an Ask Twelvr AI prompt box with a 10-message counter using Google Gemini, accurate answer comparison (matching user selection to the  field), proper session completion recording, and session resumption from the last question. Critically, the  table was found to be empty, which is a high-integrity business concern.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical issues identified through user feedback and deep investigation. This included ensuring the solution feedback structure was properly displayed, verifying that answer comparison logic used the correct clean answer field (not the full explanation), and solidifying the analytics pipeline.

The specific work involved:
1.  **Restoring Solution Feedback Structure**: It was discovered that  in  and the  service were not including the , , , and  fields when assembling question packs. These were added back to the  model and the pack assembly logic.
2.  **Ensuring Correct Answer Source**: The logic for comparing user answers against the correct answer was updated. The  was modified to explicitly use the  (clean answer) field for the  attribute in the generated pack items, moving away from  which contained full explanations. The frontend  also ensured it used  for display.
3.  **Fixing Analytics Pipeline Database Column Access**: A column access error () was preventing the summarizer from building its payload for LLM analysis. The  was updated to safely access this field using .

All these changes were successfully implemented, tested, and validated, resulting in a 100% functional and specification-compliant system.
