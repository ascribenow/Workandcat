The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles a complex, iterative process of enhancing the Twelvr application, primarily focusing on its adaptive learning and content categorization systems. The initial phase involved extensive debugging related to a PostgreSQL migration and subsequent taxonomy updates, followed by critical fixes for session generation and LLM-based enrichment. The core challenge evolved from ensuring 12-question sessions to implementing robust taxonomy triple (Category, Subcategory, Type) enforcement with 100% coverage. This necessitated multiple database migrations, resolving subtle SQLAlchemy async/sync incompatibilities, and refining LLM prompting. The final major challenge centered on implementing dual-dimension diversity (subcategory then type) in session generation, which exposed issues with the question database's inherent lack of diversity. The engineer meticulously debugged and refined the session logic, ultimately concluding that a new, more diverse dataset was needed to fully validate the implemented dual-dimension diversity.

The Twelvr application is an AI-powered CAT Quantitative Aptitude preparation platform. Its primary goal is to provide personalized, adaptive learning through features like AI-powered question scoring, LLM enrichment for missing fields, real-time MCQ generation, and JWT authentication. Admin functionalities include PYQ/Question Upload and Export. The application uses a FastAPI backend and React frontend, with a PostgreSQL database (Supabase).

Recent development aimed to improve adaptive learning, including time-weighted frequency analysis, 12-question adaptive sessions with LLM-generated solutions, and student progress summaries. UI was rebranded to Twelvr, and admin features expanded to include CSV export/upload of PYQs with LLM enrichment and image support.

The user's explicit requests throughout the trajectory evolved from an initial comprehensive taxonomy update to specific enhancements:
1.  **Complete Taxonomy Triple Enforcement**: Ensure every question record is enriched with Category, Subcategory, and Type from a canonical list, achieving 100% population. This taxonomy triple must be enforced in the database and LLM enrichment.
2.  **Session Engine Integration**: Use Type as a first-class dimension for all selection, diversity caps, mastery, cooldowns, and PYQ weighting.
3.  **LLM Enrichment Logic**: Correctly use LLM calls for Subcategory -> Type -> Category mapping, and ensure this applies to all questions, including PYQs, without hardcoded patterns.
4.  **Session Engine Priority**: Prioritize Type diversity enforcement, with quantity fallback only when Type diversity is insufficient.
5.  **Achieve 100% Success Rate**: Ensure the system's critical components work flawlessly, especially taxonomy population and session generation.
6.  **Dual-Dimension Diversity**: Enforce diversity at the subcategory level first (max 5 questions), then within that, across types (max 2-3 of same type). Maximize subcategory coverage, then ensure type diversity within chosen subcategories.
7.  **Database Reset and Re-enrichment**: Delete existing questions and replace them with a provided  file, then re-run LLM enrichment to assess the system with a new dataset.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



-   : The main FastAPI application serving as the central API hub.
    -   **Changes**: Initially refactored , fixed JSON import order, added . Modified  endpoint to include  in responses. Crucially, the  endpoint was continuously refined to properly integrate with , handling database session  correctly (from ), and ensuring it returns the actual questions array and complete session metadata.
-   : Defines database schema (SQLAlchemy models) and handles ORM operations.
    -   **Changes**:  and  models were added. The  model was used for categories, subcategories, and types.  function's generator nature was a key point of debugging for the session endpoint.
-   : Manages LLM-based question enrichment and classification.
    -   **Changes**:  method is central for PYQ classification and ensuring canonical taxonomy alignment. It was verified to use actual LLM calls for classification. The internal taxonomy mapping in this file was aligned with the canonical structure.
-   : Contains the core logic for adaptive session generation.
    -   **Changes**: Initially updated , fixed  reference, relaxed  (3 to 12) and  (4 to 1), and added robust fallback. The significant changes involved integrating Type as a first-class dimension. This included updating  and modifying , , and  to incorporate type-based selection, diversity caps (, ), and metadata tracking. Extensive refactoring was done to convert async database calls to synchronous to resolve  errors and method signature mismatches. The  method was implemented with dynamic  (default 5, later 3) and  (default 3, later 2 for Basics, 1 for specific types). The question pool selection was improved to seek diversity initially.
-   : The central UI for students and admins.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed a JSX syntax error and added Check Quality and Fix Solutions buttons for admin tasks.
-   : Implements the 12-question adaptive session UI.
    -   **Changes**: Added  state and updated display.
-   : **NEW file**. Created to display uploaded PYQ files in the admin UI.
-   : A directory for various utility and migration scripts.
    -   ** (NEW)**: Script to migrate database questions to canonical Category, Subcategory, and Type. Faced issues with old category formats and SQLAlchemy OR conditions.
    -   ** (NEW)**: Updates session engine for type-based selection.
    -   ** (NEW)**: More efficient script to populate the Type field in questions.
    -   ** (NEW)**: Script for sophisticated LLM-based canonical Type assignment (initially had issues with over-classification to Basics).

<pending_tasks>
-   **Database Replacement and Re-enrichment**: The user has provided a new  file and explicitly requested to delete all existing questions, replace them with the new data, and then run LLM enrichment on this new dataset. This is the task currently being set up.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on a critical user request: replacing the entire existing questions database with a new, more diverse dataset provided by the user in . This task was initiated because the previous dual-dimension diversity enforcement, while logically correct, was hampered by the existing database's overwhelming concentration of Time-Speed-Distance subcategory and Basics type questions (98.4% and 96.4% respectively). This data imbalance forced the session generation's fallback logic to kick in, overriding the carefully implemented diversity caps to ensure 12 questions were always generated, thus negating the diversity efforts.

The AI engineer has successfully analyzed the new CSV file, noting its diversity across various quantitative aptitude topics. A new script, , has been created to perform this database replacement and subsequent re-enrichment of the new questions using the LLM. The goal is to provide a clean, diverse dataset to properly test and demonstrate the effectiveness of the dual-dimension diversity enforcement, which was confirmed to be logically sound but data-constrained. The engineer is now poised to execute this script.
