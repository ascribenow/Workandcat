<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned a CAT preparation MVP from MongoDB/FastAPI/React to a robust PostgreSQL/FastAPI/React production system. Key achievements include comprehensive backend re-engineering with SQLAlchemy for 15+ tables, implementing core AI modules (LLM enrichment, diagnostic, MCQ generation, study planning, mastery tracking), and resolving numerous backend bugs. Frontend efforts focused on integrating with the new backend and adapting the UI for specific user flows (admin/student dashboards, diagnostic, study plan). The work progressed through fixing initial integration issues, enhancing the mastery dashboard, integrating background jobs, and then addressing critical issues identified through testing, such as database schema constraints, JWT errors, and diagnostic system discrepancies. The latest work involved a deep dive into resolving persistent issues with formula integration, diagnostic question distribution, and difficulty representation, aiming for a 100% success rate, which are still in progress.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete implementation of formula integration (current test success rate is 37%, needs ≥60%).

-   Fix missing proper difficulty distribution (currently 100% Medium, 0% Easy/Hard).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving three critical issues that were preventing the application from achieving a 100% success rate in comprehensive testing:
1.  **Formula Integration:** The backend's formula calculations, particularly for scoring, were not fully integrated, showing a low success rate (37% against a target of ≥60%). This means core AI-powered metrics are not being computed correctly.
2.  **25-Question Diagnostic Distribution:** The diagnostic test, which is crucial for new user onboarding and study plan generation, had incorrect question distribution, with 17 out of 25 questions falling into an Unknown category. This indicates a problem with how questions are categorized or selected for the diagnostic set, directly impacting the personalized learning experience.
3.  **Missing Proper Difficulty Distribution:** All questions in the diagnostic were incorrectly categorized as Medium difficulty, with 0% in Easy or Hard categories. This suggests an issue with the difficulty assignment or retrieval logic, impacting the adaptive nature of the test.

To address these, the AI engineer previously created and ran scripts like , , and . However, the latest comprehensive test results (Chat Message 327) indicate these issues *persist*, despite previous attempts at fixing them. The last action taken was creating a new script  (Chat Message 330) to implement what are now considered the REAL fixes for these lingering problems, acknowledging that previous solutions were insufficient.
