The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the CAT preparation platform from a PostgreSQL-based system to one utilizing SQLite for the database, addressing user concerns about PostgreSQL issues. Key accomplishments include fixing a critical UI bug where the Add Question form in the admin panel was not opening, streamlining the question creation form by removing the Detailed Solution field due to LLM auto-enrichment, and extensively enhancing the backend. A major focus was the implementation of a sophisticated LLM-powered conceptual frequency analysis system, which moved beyond simple subcategory matching to analyze conceptual similarity between questions and PYQ patterns. This system also incorporated time-weighted relevance for PYQ data (20 years stored, 10 years emphasized). The engineer also integrated a robust fallback enrichment system to ensure accurate mathematical answers even if the primary LLM API fails. Database schema issues related to the new frequency fields were identified and resolved through migrations. The current state reflects a stable backend with fixed LLM enrichment and an ongoing migration to SQLite.

<product_requirements>
The CAT Quantitative Aptitude preparation platform aims to provide personalized and adaptive learning, transitioning from an MVP to a robust stack. It features a PostgreSQL backend (now moving to SQLite) with 15+ tables, AI-powered question scoring (4-factor difficulty, LLM enrichment for all missing fields), and an adaptive study planning system with three tracks and daily minimums. The system limits question attempts, updates learning impact and mastery via nightly background jobs, and generates real-time MCQs. Authentication uses JWT with hardcoded admin access. The UI supports student dashboards and admin functions (PYQ/Question Upload, Export). Content is categorized using a canonical QA taxonomy (5 main, 29 subcategories). A 25-question diagnostic test was removed. Recent additions include comprehensive image support via Google Drive links for bulk CSV uploads, LLM auto-generation of question details, and a policy against serving image-based questions without working images. The user specifically requested a time-weighted frequency analysis using 20 years of PYQ data with emphasis on the last 10 years, and later, migration to SQLite.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing PostgreSQL database issues reported by the user and, per the user's explicit request, initiated a migration from PostgreSQL to SQLite.

The previous work involved a significant overhaul of the question enrichment and frequency analysis systems:
1.  **Add Question Form Fix**: Initially, the Add Question button in the admin panel's single question upload section was not opening any form. The engineer debugged , identified the issue (likely related to  or  state), and fixed it.
2.  **Form Simplification**: The user requested removing the Detailed Solution box from the Add Question form, as LLM handles this. This was successfully implemented in .
3.  **LLM Enrichment Pipeline Fix**: The LLM enrichment was initially broken, leading to silly updates (placeholder text). This was traced to incorrect LLM client initialization and a missing  method in . These were fixed, and a robust  was implemented to ensure accurate mathematical answers even if the LLM API fails.
4.  **Conceptual Frequency Analysis**: A major feature addition was the LLM-powered conceptual frequency analysis. This involved creating  to analyze question patterns conceptually (not just by text match), integrating it into , and updating  with .
5.  **Time-Weighted Frequency Analysis**: Responding to the user's requirement for 20-year PYQ data with 10-year relevance,  was implemented. This uses exponential decay to weight recent PYQ data more heavily.
6.  **Database Schema Synchronization**: Multiple issues arose where new frequency-related fields in SQLAlchemy models were not present in the actual PostgreSQL database. Migration scripts (, ) were created and executed to ensure all 10 new frequency analysis columns were properly added and indexed.
7.  **Database Migration to SQLite**: The user requested switching from PostgreSQL to a cloud-agnostic database integrated with the Emergent Universal Key. After clarifying that the Emergent Universal Key is for LLM services, the engineer recommended SQLite as a free, zero-maintenance solution. The  file has been successfully updated to use SQLite.

The immediate current work is updating the remaining backend components, starting with , to fully transition the application to use the SQLite database.
