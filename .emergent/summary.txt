The AI engineer successfully transitioned the Twelvr application from a foundational MVP to a more refined and feature-rich product. Early work focused on stabilizing core functionalities: fixing API URL inconsistencies, implementing two-step email verification, and improving UI/UX with features like a show password toggle and custom session loading messages. Architecturally, a significant decision was made to move  generation and MCQ validation from real-time LLM calls to background processes, protecting admin-provided content.

During the recorded trajectory, several critical issues and feature enhancements were addressed. The Gmail OAuth tokens expired, which was resolved through user-assisted re-authentication. The UI received extensive updates: logos were made responsive to light/dark backgrounds, the Landing Page's copy was completely revamped to be AI-centric, and UI glitches like content shifting during form toggles were fixed. Obsolete 'Early Access' sections were removed.

The pricing page underwent a major redesign, introducing Free Trial, Pro Lite, and Pro Regular tiers with detailed features, updated pricing, and strategic highlighting for the Pro Regular plan as Ideal for CAT 2025. Policy pages were populated with official content and ensured consistent headers/footers. Navigation across the app was improved with smooth scroll-to-top functionality. A major Razorpay payment gateway integration was implemented, covering order creation, subscriptions (Pro Lite auto-renewal), and webhooks. The engineer also enhanced the Contact Us page and clarified Twelvr's focus on Quantitative Ability in legal documents and FAQs. The current work involves debugging non-clickable Razorpay payment buttons, likely related to authentication.

The Twelvr application is an adaptive learning platform for CAT preparation, initially built with a professional UI, Gmail OAuth2 two-step email verification, a three-phase adaptive session system, LLM-powered question enrichment (protecting admin fields), and a quality control system for  and MCQ options. Previous UX enhancements included a show password toggle, custom session loading messages, a favicon, and removal of the Made with Emergent badge.

New requirements and fixes addressed in this trajectory were:
- Update Twelvr logo with a new file, adapting its usage for light and dark backgrounds.
- Resolve Failed to send verification email error due to expired Gmail OAuth tokens.
- Rectify backend references to , confirming usage of user's own LLM keys and Supabase PostgreSQL.
- Revamp Landing Page: update copy, change feature icons, fix UI shifting on sign-in/sign-up, and adjust punctuation (hyphens to commas, remove periods from single lines).
- Remove 'Early Access' section and its navigation links across the application.
- Ensure all page navigation (especially from footers) scrolls to the top of the destination page.
- Redesign the Pricing page: introduce Free Trial, Pro Lite, and Pro Regular tiers with specific sessions/duration, update pricing (Pro Lite ₹1,495, Pro Regular ₹2,565), add features (Mindprint, Trend Matrix, Reflex Loop, Learning Impact, Ask Twelvr, reports, syllabus coverage), and highlight Pro Regular as Ideal for CAT 2025.
- Update Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, and Cancellation & Refund pages with provided content, ensuring consistent header/footer.
- Clarify Twelvr's specialization in Quantitative Ability in FAQs and Terms & Conditions.
- Integrate Razorpay for payment processing: link to CTA buttons, enable auto-renewal for Pro Lite, support all Razorpay payment options, using provided API keys.
- Enhance the Contact Us page with  email, and engaging copy offering real-time technical help and requesting student feedback.
- Rectify non-clickable Razorpay payment buttons on the Pricing page.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently debugging an issue on the Pricing page where the Razorpay payment buttons are not clickable and thus not initiating the payment flow. The user explicitly reported this problem, indicating a critical blocker for monetization. The engineer has begun investigating , which handles the client-side Razorpay integration. An initial step involved adding logic to ensure proper user authentication using the  hook and implementing enhanced error handling within this component. The immediate next action is to address the scenario where a user, not logged in, attempts to click a payment button, by providing a login prompt or appropriate fallback.

<optional_next_step>
Add a fallback mechanism in  to prompt users to log in if they attempt to initiate a payment while unauthenticated.
