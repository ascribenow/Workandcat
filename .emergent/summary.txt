The previous AI engineer successfully migrated the CAT preparation platform from PostgreSQL to SQLite, a major architectural shift, and addressed initial UI bugs. Subsequently, the engineer implemented significant feature enhancements: a 12-question session system, improved answer submission with detailed solutions, and a comprehensive student dashboard. A critical phase involved fixing numerous backend and frontend routing, data type, and parameter mismatch issues, especially for MCQ generation and session flow. Most recently, the engineer implemented a sophisticated, adaptive session logic for personalized question selection. The current work involved simplifying the PYQ frequency analysis and then, facing issues while creating sample PYQ data. The trajectory concludes with the engineer troubleshooting asynchronous database operation errors in a script to populate PYQ data, indicating an unfinished task related to data generation and testing for the simplified PYQ system.

<product_requirements>
The CAT Quantitative Aptitude preparation platform, originally MVP with PostgreSQL, is transitioning to a robust, portable stack using SQLite. It provides personalized, adaptive learning with AI-powered question scoring (4-factor difficulty, LLM enrichment for missing fields), and an adaptive study planning system. Key features include limited question attempts, nightly learning impact/mastery updates, real-time MCQ generation, and JWT authentication. Admin functions support PYQ/Question Upload and Export. Content is structured by a canonical taxonomy. Recent additions include comprehensive image support via Google Drive, LLM auto-generation of question details, and a policy against serving image-based questions without working images. Explicit user requests included: time-weighted frequency analysis using 20 years of PYQ data (10 years emphasized), later changed to simple PYQ frequency, migration to SQLite, a 12-question, non-time-bound session structure where students must answer before proceeding, comprehensive solution display, very detailed LLM-generated solutions, and a student summary showing all categories/subcategories with solved question counts by difficulty. Finally, the user requested sophisticated, adaptive session logic.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with simplifying the PYQ (Previous Year Questions) logic. This involved:
1.  **Creating **: A new file to handle direct frequency counting.
2.  **Updating **: Replacing the complex conceptual and time-weighted frequency analyzers with the new simple PYQ frequency calculator. This also involved fixing parameter mismatches during initialization.
3.  **Updating **: Modifying the manual run endpoint for the nightly engine to use the simplified version.
4.  **Updating **: Adjusting the scheduled nightly processing job to invoke the  correctly, including passing the database session.
5.  **Removing old files**: Deleting  and  which are no longer needed.

After these code changes, initial backend testing confirmed the simplified PYQ system was working correctly but noted there was no PYQ data in the database yet to calculate frequencies from. The engineer then initiated the creation of a script, , to populate this data.

The current work is stalled at this point as the  script is failing with  and , indicating issues with asynchronous database operations within the script. The engineer attempted direct API testing, which also resulted in similar errors, suggesting a fundamental async/await or session handling problem in the test or script environment.
