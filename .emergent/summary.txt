<analysis>
The previous AI engineer initiated development of a CAT preparation application based on an initial product outline, employing a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a React frontend. The initial phase focused on setting up a basic question bank, study plan, and authentication. A key bug related to MongoDB ObjectId serialization was identified and fixed. Following this, the user requested an authentication system upgrade, leading to Firebase integration and hardcoded admin access. A critical pivot occurred when the user provided a *new*, significantly more detailed product outline, rendering the existing implementation a solid MVP/prototype. The AI engineer performed a thorough gap analysis, identifying major architectural and feature disparities (e.g., MongoDB to PostgreSQL, basic AI to advanced 4-factor scoring, missing diagnostic/mastery systems). The user explicitly chose a Complete Rebuild to match the full specification. The AI engineer has since started this rebuild, migrating to PostgreSQL, establishing a new database schema, and creating numerous core backend modules for advanced features like LLM enrichment, diagnostic, MCQ generation, study planning, mastery tracking, and background jobs. The system is in a transitional state, with backend infrastructure for the rebuild largely established but pending full integration and frontend updates.

<product_requirements>
The overall product is a comprehensive CAT Quantitative Aptitude preparation application. Initially, it was envisioned with a 90-day optimization focus, three database systems (Question Bank, PYQ, User Preparedness), a canonical taxonomy (5 main categories, 28 sub-categories), and metadata for questions. Admin features included PDF upload for PYQ ingestion.

The updated, definitive product outline dictates a production-ready system with significantly advanced features:
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with 15+ interconnected tables (, , , , , etc.).
- **AI Scoring:** Sophisticated 4-factor difficulty formula (, ).
- **Diagnostic System:** A 25-question fixed-blueprint diagnostic with capability scoring (, , ).
- **Study Planning:** Advanced system with three tracks (Beginner/Intermediate/Good), rolling , daily 30-minute minimums, and budget management.
- **Attempt Management:** Max 3 attempts per question with specific retry intervals and hint support.
- **Background Processing:** Nightly jobs for dynamic Learning Impact, Mastery percentage updates, and frequency analysis.
- **MCQ Generation:** Real-time, on-demand option generation with misconception-based distractors.
- **Authentication:** Professional system, with a hardcoded admin email for password reset (specifically ).
- **UI:** Minimalistic student and admin interfaces.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



**Key Files and Changes:**
- : Initially, this was the main FastAPI application. It contained API routes for basic functions like  and . It was updated multiple times for the initial build, including fixing the MongoDB ObjectID serialization issue and integrating the Firebase authentication system.
- : Contains environment variables. Initially configured for MongoDB (), it has been updated to include PostgreSQL connection details (, , , , ).
- : Python dependencies. Updated to include , , , and  to support Firebase authentication and PostgreSQL integration.

<current_work>
The immediate focus before this summary request was on the Complete Rebuild phase, specifically establishing the core backend infrastructure and database. The AI engineer has successfully:
1.  **Migrated the database setup from MongoDB to PostgreSQL**: This involved installing PostgreSQL on the system, updating the  file with PostgreSQL connection details, and creating  which defines the SQLAlchemy models for all 15+ tables required by the new specification (e.g., , , , , ). The database was successfully initialized.
2.  **Created numerous new backend modules**: These modules are designed to implement the advanced features from the second product outline. This includes:
    *    for advanced AI scoring.
    *    for the 25-question diagnostic.
    *    for real-time MCQ option generation.
    *    for sophisticated study plan creation.
    *    for progress tracking.
    *    for nightly processing tasks.
    *   , intended as the new main FastAPI application to house all these integrated features.
3.  **Updated authentication for PostgreSQL**: The existing  was modified to work with the PostgreSQL database.
4.  **Prepared for data population**: A new script  was created to populate the PostgreSQL database.

The current state reflects a significant backend transformation, setting the foundation for the complex features required by the final specification. The database is initialized, and core logical modules are in place, awaiting full integration into the main server and subsequent frontend development.
