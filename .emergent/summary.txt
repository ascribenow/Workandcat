The trajectory outlines the transition of the Twelvr application from an AI engineer to a human expert. The AI engineer successfully brought the app from 0 to 1, implementing core features like branding, authentication, session management, and a doubt resolution system. Initial tasks involved environment setup, dependency installation, and a comprehensive codebase exploration to understand the existing state.

Key achievements include the integration of Gmail OAuth2, the development of a sophisticated question enrichment pipeline (now refined to protect admin fields), and the implementation of a robust quality control system for  and MCQ options. The engineer also fixed critical issues like inconsistent API URL handling in the frontend, leading to a Failed to start/resume session error, and corrected the sign-up flow to enforce two-step email verification.

More recently, the focus has been on user experience enhancements, such as a show password feature and a custom session loading message. Crucially, a major performance bottleneck related to real-time LLM calls during session loading was identified and resolved by moving  generation and MCQ validation to question upload and nightly processes. The engineer also addressed Supabase RLS warnings, concluding they were not critical for the current architecture. The final task involved implementing a new favicon and removing the Made with Emergent badge. The codebase is now in a production-ready state, with detailed documentation of all formulas and logic.

The Twelvr application is an educational platform designed to provide adaptive learning experiences, focusing on CAT preparation. The initial build established core functionalities:
- **Branding & UI**: Professional Duolingo-style landing page, consistent header/footer, clickable logos, responsive design.
- **Authentication**: Email-based system with Gmail OAuth2 integration, requiring two-step email verification for sign-up.
- **Navigation**: Six dummy pages (Pricing, Early Access, Contact Us, Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, Cancellation & Refund Policy) with integrated React Router.
- **Session System**: Three-Phase Adaptive Session System (12-question sessions), type-level mastery tracking, sophisticated question selection logic based on difficulty, category, and user performance.
- **Question Management**: LLM-powered enrichment for metadata (difficulty, frequency, learning impact), human-friendly mathematical solution display.
- **Doubt Resolution**: Gemini-powered feature (implied, mentioned in initial summary).

Recent enhancements include:
- ** Column**: Addition of a new column to the questions table to store LLM-generated precise answers.
- **Revised LLM Enrichment Flow**: Admin-provided fields (, , , , , ) must remain untouched by LLMs.  is generated by OpenAI based on the stem, and other metadata fields are enriched by LLMs.
- **Quality Control**: Implement cross-validation between LLM-generated  and admin's  (deactivating mismatches). Validate MCQ options to ensure admin's  is in exactly one option, with automatic regeneration. These validations occur at question upload time and during nightly checks.
- **Session Data Control**: Sessions should only fetch the admin's  field, never the  field.
- **Frontend UX Improvements**: Show password toggle on login/signup forms, updated session loading message to Consistency, Compounded. Twelvr is compiling your perfect session., and removal of a redundant Start New Session button.
- **Aesthetics**: Custom favicon and removal of the Made with Emergent badge.

<pending_tasks>
- **Three-Phase Adaptive Session System Difficulty Distribution**: The initial summary mentioned a bug where it's showing 100% Medium questions instead of 75% Medium, 20% Easy, 5% Hard. This was noted but not addressed.

<current_work>
The most recent work involved refining the frontend user experience and resolving remaining aesthetic elements. Specifically, the Made with Emergent badge was identified and successfully removed from the main HTML template (, lines 51-97). This action aimed to ensure the Twelvr platform maintained a completely clean and professional appearance without external branding elements. The  agent was used to verify the successful removal across multiple pages, confirming that the platform now displays only its own branding. This task directly followed the successful implementation of the favicon, continuing the focus on UI/UX polish.
