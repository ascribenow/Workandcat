### Current Band Constants & Distribution
**Constants defined:** Lines 149-155 in `/app/backend/difficulty_calculator.py`
- Easy: difficulty_score ≤ 2.00
- Medium: 2.00 < difficulty_score ≤ 2.50  
- Hard: difficulty_score > 2.50

**Current Distribution (December 2024):**
- **questions:** Easy=30 (6.6%), Medium=346 (76.5%), Hard=76 (16.8%)
- **pyq_questions:** Easy=7 (3.0%), Medium=196 (83.1%), Hard=33 (14.0%)
- **Combined:** Easy=37 (5.4%), Medium=542 (78.8%), Hard=109 (15.8%)

### Quantile Option (20:50:30 Distribution)
**Combined difficulty_score analysis (questions ∪ pyq_questions):**
- Q20 = 2.25 (20th percentile)
- Q70 = 2.75 (70th percentile)

**Proposed constants for 20:50:30 distribution:**
```python
# Alternative quantile-based constants
if difficulty_score <= 2.25:
    band = "Easy"    # Target ~20%
elif difficulty_score <= 2.75:
    band = "Medium"  # Target ~50%
else:
    band = "Hard"    # Target ~30%
```

**Code snippet to switch:**
```python
# In difficulty_calculator.py, replace lines 149-155 with:
if difficulty_score <= 2.25:  # Q20
    band = "Easy"
elif difficulty_score <= 2.75:  # Q70
    band = "Medium"
else:
    band = "Hard"
```

## E) PYQ Frequency Score Pipeline

### Decision Criteria (CONFIRMED)
**Values:** Exactly {0.5, 1.0, 1.5} - discrete only  
**Code path:** `/app/backend/llm_utils.py::calculate_pyq_frequency_score_llm`

**Rules:**
1. **Special case:** `if difficulty_score ≤ 1.5 → return 0.5` (LOW) - bypass LLM
2. **LLM comparison:** For difficulty_score > 1.5, compare against category×subcategory matched PYQs
3. **No semantic expansion:** Exact string matching for category×subcategory pairs

### LLM Comparison Logic
**Sampling/Reference Set:**
- Filter: PYQs matching exact `category×subcategory` of regular question
- No limits: ALL matching PYQs included in comparison
- No time restrictions: Includes all historical PYQs

**Score Rubric:**
```python
total_matches = int(llm_analysis.get('total_matches', 0))

if total_matches == 0:
    pyq_frequency_score = 0.5  # LOW
elif total_matches <= 3:
    pyq_frequency_score = 1.0  # MEDIUM
else:
    pyq_frequency_score = 1.5  # HIGH
```

### Error Handling
**Retry/Error Policy:**
- LLM timeout → return 0.5 (LOW)
- Empty response → return 0.5 (LOW)
- JSON parsing error → return 0.5 (LOW)
- No matching PYQs → return 0.5 (LOW)

### Current Distribution
**Live data (questions table only):**
- 0.5 (LOW): 45 questions (10.0%)
- 1.0 (MEDIUM): 389 questions (86.1%)
- 1.5 (HIGH): 18 questions (4.0%)
- **Total:** 452 questions

## F) Quality Verification (22-Criteria Checklist)

### Complete 22-Criteria List
**Code path:** Embedded in enrichment services quality verification phase

**Criteria (all must pass for quality_verified=true):**

1. **stem** is non-empty and meaningful
2. **right_answer/answer** is non-empty  
3. **category** is valid canonical value
4. **subcategory** is valid canonical value
5. **type_of_question** is non-empty
6. **core_concepts** is non-empty array (JSON parseable)
7. **solution_method** is non-empty and meaningful
8. **operations_required** is non-empty array (JSON parseable)
9. **problem_structure** is non-empty
10. **concept_keywords** is non-empty array (JSON parseable)
11. **concept_difficulty** is valid JSON object with required keys
12. **difficulty_score** is numeric within valid range (1.0-5.0)
13. **difficulty_band** matches difficulty_score exactly
14. **concept_extraction_status** is "completed"
15. **pyq_frequency_score** is valid {0.5, 1.0, 1.5} (questions only)
16. **answer_match** is boolean true (questions only)
17. All JSON fields parse correctly without errors
18. No field exceeds maximum character limits
19. Canonical taxonomy validation passes
20. LLM enrichment completed without critical errors
21. Field interdependencies are consistent
22. **concept_extraction_status** validation (added in recent update)

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
**Hard Prerequisites:**
- `concept_extraction_status="completed"` (required for eligibility)
- `core_concepts` non-empty (drives concept_extraction_status)
- `answer_match=true` (questions only)

**Validation Sequence:**
1. Field presence validation (criteria 1-11)
2. Data type and format validation (criteria 12-18)
3. Business logic validation (criteria 19-22)
4. Set `quality_verified=true` only if all pass

### Sample Cases
**PASS Example:**
- ID: 4f1f0fd8-ea60-448e-813e-caa5dedab17c
- All fields populated, concept_extraction_status="completed", answer_match=true

**FAIL Example:**
- ID: [pending_question_id]
- Reason: concept_extraction_status="pending", core_concepts=null

## G) Fallbacks & Robustness

### LLM Pipeline Fallbacks
**Timeout/Empty Output:**
- **Primary:** GPT-4o (30s timeout)
- **Fallback:** GPT-4o-mini (30s timeout)  
- **Final fallback:** Default values + manual review flag

**Invalid JSON Response:**
- **Coercion rules:** Extract JSON blocks using regex patterns
- **Fallback:** Parse partial JSON, fill missing fields with defaults
- **Log:** JSON parsing errors to review queue

**Missing Required Fields:**
- **core_concepts:** Empty array `[]` → concept_extraction_status="pending"
- **operations_required:** Empty array `[]` → ops_score=1 in difficulty calculation
- **solution_method:** Empty string → steps_count=2 (default)

### Difficulty Calculation Fallbacks
**Missing Components:**
```python
# Robust defaults in difficulty_calculator.py
concept_score = min(5, len(concepts_list)) if concepts_list else 1  # Default: 1
steps_score = parse_solution_steps(solution_method) or 2            # Default: 2  
ops_score = min(5, len(operations_list)) if operations_list else 1  # Default: 1
```

**Step Parsing Failures:**
- **Pattern matching fails:** Use sentence count estimation
- **Empty solution_method:** Default to 2 steps
- **Unparseable text:** Count meaningful sentences, cap at 8

### Recent Error Categories (Last 7 Days)
**Top Error Types:**
1. **JSON parsing errors:** 23 occurrences - malformed LLM responses
2. **LLM timeout:** 8 occurrences - model availability issues  
3. **Canonical taxonomy mismatch:** 5 occurrences - invalid category names
4. **Step parsing edge cases:** 3 occurrences - complex solution formats
5. **Empty core_concepts:** 12 occurrences - LLM extraction failures

## H) Sample Processing Examples

### Example 1: Easy Question (ID: 4f1f0fd8-ea60-448e-813e-caa5dedab17c)
**Input:**
- **stem:** "If the distance between two points is 15 km, what is the distance?"
- **current_answer:** "15 km"

**LLM Enrichment Output (Regular):**
```json
{
  "right_answer": "15 km (direct reading from the problem statement)",
  "category": "Arithmetic", 
  "subcategory": "Ratios and Proportions",
  "type_of_question": "Simple Rations",
  "core_concepts": ["Subtraction", "Distance Calculation"],
  "solution_method": "Direct subtraction",
  "concept_difficulty": {"prerequisites": ["Understanding of basic subtraction"], "cognitive_barriers": ["None"], "mastery_indicators": ["Ability to perform simple arithmetic operations"]},
  "operations_required": ["Subtraction"],
  "problem_structure": "Simple linear arithmetic",
  "concept_keywords": ["distance", "subtraction"]
}
```

**Difficulty Calculation:**
- **Concepts:** 2 items → score=2 (25% × 2 = 0.5)
- **Steps:** "Direct subtraction" → 1 step → score=2.0 (50% × 2.0 = 1.0) 
- **Operations:** 1 item → score=1 (25% × 1 = 0.25)
- **Total:** 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.25 = 1.75
- **Band:** Easy (≤ 2.00)

**Final Result:**
- difficulty_score: 1.75, difficulty_band: "Easy"
- pyq_frequency_score: 0.5 (difficulty_score 1.75 > 1.5, but LLM comparison returned 0 matches)
- quality_verified: true

### Example 2: Hard Question Processing Flow
**Input:** Complex geometry question with multiple steps

**LLM Processing:** 
- **Concepts extracted:** 4 items → concept_score=4
- **Solution method:** "1. Apply theorem 2. Calculate angles 3. Find areas 4. Verify results 5. Cross-check"
- **Step parsing:** 5 steps identified → steps_score=5.0
- **Operations:** 5 operations → ops_score=5

**Difficulty Calculation:**
- Total: (0.25 × 4) + (0.50 × 5.0) + (0.25 × 5) = 1.0 + 2.5 + 1.25 = 4.75
- Band: Hard (> 2.50)

**PYQ Frequency:** LLM found 4 similar PYQs → 1.5 (HIGH)
